Cape Town - One of the province s most sensational court cases - the corruption trial of former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer - is finally expected to be heard in the Western Cape High Court early next year.The trial date, March 6, was set on Friday when Lamoer and five co-accused briefly appeared before Judge Elize Steyn for a pre-trial conference. The judge was provided with a detailed minute that showed that everyone involved in the case had ironed out any kinks which could hamper the smooth running of the trial.Minor concerns which defence advocate, Pete Mihalik, had over his client s instructions will be addressed before the scheduled trial date, the court was assured. Mihalik also represents Stellenbosch police cluster commander Brigadier Darius van der Ross. Judge Steyn was happy that the matter was ready and set a trial date for March.Lamoer and his co-accused face 109 charges of corruption and racketeering. The co-accused include Van der Ross and two other police officials brigadiers Kolindren Govender and (his wife) Sharon Govender. Cape Town businessman Mohamed Saleem Dawjee and his son Mohamed Zameer Dawjee will also share the dock with the police officials.According to the indictment, Lamoer and the three police officials allegedly received R1.6 million in bribes from the Dawjees in return for their influence.Lamoer was appointed to the post in November 2010 and retired in November 2015. He had been in the service for 25 years.Weekend Argus
