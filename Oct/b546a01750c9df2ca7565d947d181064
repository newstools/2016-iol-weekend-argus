Cape Town - Convicted paedophile Anthony Peter Freedendal, who faces 24 child sex charges in his home country, Australia, will spend the festive season fighting an application for his extradition.In the days leading up to Christmas, prosecuting authorities will set out to prove to the Wynberg Magistrate&#x2019;s Court that Freedendal should be sent back to Port Lincoln in South Australia to face the music there.But his attorney, William Booth, is expected to put up fierce opposition.The basis for his opposition to the application has not been divulged.Freedendal is being sought in connection with charges of indecent assault, persistent sexual exploitation of a child and unlawful sexual intercourse.The offences date back 17 years, and were allegedly committed from June 1999 to January 2003.The alleged victims were aged from seven to 11, and included a nine-year-old intellectually disabled girl, a seven-year-old boy, a girl who was allegedly abused from the age of eight to 11, and four other girls.Documents before the court show he faces five life terms plus 150 years behind bars in Australia if he is convicted.Freedendal was arrested in July 2011. He was allowed to visit South Africa on condition he return by November 21 that year. He never returned. While in Cape Town, he was arrested and charged with the sexual abuse of eight local children.A plea and sentencing agreement saw him sentenced to five years in jail in terms of Section 276(1)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which meant he only had to serve 10 months, then the remainder under correctional supervision. He has made several appearances before the parole board since reaching that 10-month mark, and in July the board confirmed his release date for August 5.But his release was halted after the Australian government requested his provisional arrest.
