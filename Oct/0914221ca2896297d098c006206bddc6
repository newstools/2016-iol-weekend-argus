HUNDREDS of Capetonians, wine and Champagne glasses in hand, strolled the lawns of the Castle of Good Hope, admiring show gardens and floral displays on the second day of the Cape Town Flower Show.The event, which started on Thursday, includes 20 show gardens by some of the country&#x2019;s top landscape designers, as well as talks by gardening experts, a cut flower arrangement competition, an art exhibition and the latest in gardeners&#x2019; accessories.The four-day show, which ends at 5pm tomorrow, is modelled on the Chelsea Flower Show in the UK.Local show director Karey Evett said she was excited her idea had at last become a reality.&#x201C;It has been a long time coming and a long time in the planning.&#x201D;Thousands of visitors had already bought tickets.&#x201C;They all seem to be really enjoying it. They like the venue, they like the gardens, they like the flowers,&#x201D; Evett said.She said organisers had booked the Castle for next year and 2018. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an annual event and we are committed to it.&#x201D;After strolling through the gardens, many of which highlight indigenous plants that thrive in water-scarce environments, visitors enjoyed glasses of wine, Champagne and craft beer in a large marquee tent. Vendors, meanwhile, did brisk trade selling everything from fresh oysters and pulled pork quesadillas to ice-cream.The show includes a retail element and many visitors browsed gardeners&#x2019; accessories or bought seeds and seedlings.
