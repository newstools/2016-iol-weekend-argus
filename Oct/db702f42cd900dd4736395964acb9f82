POLICE seized a large cache of illegal firearms &#x2013; at least 250 guns &#x2013; in a house in Valhalla Park, along with ammunition and an undisclosed amount of cash yesterday.Police, who arrested four people believed to be related, said some of the firearms &#x2028;had been hidden in a vast underground bunker. The firearms were found following a tip-off.Acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane lauded the officers for their sterling detective work.&#x201C;We are confident that &#x2028;this cache will assist us in clamping down on the scourge of gangsterism as well as in reducing crime trends which affect our communities, such as murder and vehicle hijackings,&#x201D; Phahlane said.Despite the serious nature of the crime, the Valhalla Park community vented their anger at the police.Infuriated locals shouted at police, demanding they free the four suspects, who include a businessman from the area, his father and his sister.They claimed police officers, who arrived at the house at around 6:15am, tortured the main suspect.A neighbour, Eugenia Traut, said she had been woken by screaming.Traut said she feared for the man&#x2019;s life, claiming police had confiscated his medical treatment.&#x201C;We are not stopping them (police) from doing their job, but they don&#x2019;t have to be harsh. No, it&#x2019;s not right,&#x201D; Traut added.A resident, Sandra September said: &#x201C;He is a good man. He helps us here in the community and is a role model to our children. He makes his money the right way and has a construction business where he employs most of us.&#x201D;Desmond Vieldman said he grew up with the accused.&#x201C;He helps us, he is not &#x2028;violent.&#x201D;Phahlane said investigators had sealed off the premises as they were still looking for additional evidence against &#x2028;the family.
