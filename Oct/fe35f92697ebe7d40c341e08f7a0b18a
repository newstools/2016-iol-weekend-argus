MCDONALD&#x2019;S South Africa has come under fire again this week for dragging its feet in committing to using cage-free eggs in the preparation of its meals.The fast-food chain announced this week it intended sourcing cage-free eggs by 2025 in 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Similar commitments were made by McDonald&#x2019;s in the US, Canada, the EU, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.McDonald&#x2019;s South Africa said it was still assessing the feasibility of taking these steps.Greg Solomon, chief executive officer for the company, said: &#x201C;We will be in a position to make our announcement by the end of 2016.&#x201D;Four animal protection groups, Beauty without Cruelty SA, United Front 4 Animals ,the South African Faith Communities&#x2019; Environment Institute and Animal Voice, the official South African representative of Compassion in World Farming, are promoting the move and supporting a petition encouraging McDonald&#x2019;s South Africa to adopt a cage-free egg policy. To date, more than 17&#x2006;600 people have signed the petition.Student activist Yolanda Guse, who has helped spearhead the campaign, said it wasn&#x2019;t acceptable for McDonald&#x2019;s South Africa to be so indecisive.&#x201C;They keep saying they will research, but they don&#x2019;t commit. There is nothing to research, we know going cage-free is better for the chickens and it&#x2019;s better for business.&#x201D;Guse said many customers who realised the cruelty of sourcing eggs from battery hens were put off and would stop buying McDonald&#x2019;s foods.Guse said she had been a &#x201C;huge fan&#x201D; of the burger giant.While she is a meat eater, she said the cruelty involved in raising hens in cages had prompted her boycott of McDonald&#x2019;s.
