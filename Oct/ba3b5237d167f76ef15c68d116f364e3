Johannesburg &#x2013; The so-called spy tapes appeal will be heard in open court, according to a decision made by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Wednesday morning that has essentially reinstated hundreds of criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma.The National Prosecuting Authority initially withdrew the hundreds of fraud and corruption charges against Zuma after representations were made which included recorded, intercepted telephone conversations that he claimed proved the case against him was a conspiracy.The high court in Pretoria earlier this year ruled that the NPA&#x2019;s 2009 decision was irrational, meaning the decision to withdraw the charges was set aside. The NPA and the president have since approached both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts respectively to overturn the High Court decision, but last week, the apex court chose not hear the case, seemingly until the SCA had made its decision.On Wednesday morning, the SCA ruled it would rather hear oral arguments over whether the court should hear the appeal, though a court appearance date has yet to be set.The Democratic Alliance has spent six years pushing for the case against Zuma to be reinstated, and on Wednesday welcomed the SCA decision.&#x201C;To this point the president has only had his interests at heart to the detriment of South Africa, its people and the judiciary. He must take responsibility and in so doing he must immediately abandon this vexatious litigation and face the charges for which he stands accused and not plunder more of South Africans&#x2019; money into fruitless appeals,&#x201D; the party said in a statement.
