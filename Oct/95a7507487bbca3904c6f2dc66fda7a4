MARIETJIE Vosloo could face up to 60 years in a Mauritian prison if she is found guilty of the murder of her stepdaughter.That&#x2019;s according to Mauritian newspaper L&#x2019;Express, which reported yesterday that there was a &#x201C;good chance&#x201D; the South African woman from Springs would be convicted of murder.Police are, however, still investigating.The 34-year-old Vosloo appeared in court last week and was initially charged with manslaughter for causing the death of her 17-year-old stepdaughter, Mundolene.The teenager, a pupil at Ho&#xEB;rskool Hugenote, collapsed last Wednesday after her stepmother allegedly attacked her.Mundolene was on holiday with her father, Mike Vosloo, and her two brothers. They arrived on Tuesday and were staying at the Riu Creole Hotel.The case will be heard by the Assize Court.If she is found guilty and convicted, Vosloo would have to serve her sentence in Mauritius.But there is a law that allows prisoners to be extradited to their country of origin after serving two-thirds of their sentence.&#x201C;Mauritius has signed several agreements with different countries for this purpose,&#x201D;said her lawyer, Raouf Gulbul.&#x201C;Marietjie will, however, still be obliged to serve two-thirds of her sentence in Mauritius,&#x201D; he told L&#x2019; Express.Meanwhile, friends and family gathered at a church in Springs in the East Rand yesterday to say their final goodbyes to the teen.Her body was returned to South Africa on Tuesday.
