Cape Town - A first class British Airways passenger travelling from Heathrow Airport to Cape Town admitted to being an airborne pervert after he was caught sneaking his cellphone up a flight attendant s skirt in a bid to unlawfully film her. The British businessman was arrested last week when the 26-year-old attendant laid a complaint with the police. He was charged with common assault. According to British media, Martyn Vaughan, 61, lit up his first class seat with the flashlight in his cellphone before sliding the device up the attendant s skirt while she had leaned over to serve another passenger. She reportedly felt something under her skirt and turned to discover Vaughan trying to hide the phone. The woman reported being devastated after the incident. The married father of two tried to deny filming the attendant but passengers who witnessed the incident came forward. He was arrested when the plane landed in Cape Town and admitted guilt. Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said the man was released after paying an admission of guilt fine. The hostess filed a complaint against a passenger on October 15, 2016 and the suspect was arrested, Rwexana said. Vaughan, believed to be in top management at Bradden Associates in Northamptonshire, has apparently been banned by the airline. However, sanctions by the airline were not confirmed at the time of going to print.Weekend Argus
