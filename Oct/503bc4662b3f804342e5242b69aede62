A FRUSTRATED Mitchells Plain mother has tried for years to get her daughter into a special needs school. Veronica Migils s daughter, Anastacia, 11, was born with spina bifida.According to the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, spina bifida is a congenital condition which leaves a baby with an incomplete spinal column. I have been taking care of my daughter for almost 12 years now, I can continue doing that. She has been sitting in the house the whole day, every day, Migils said.In the first two years of her life, Anastacia had 10 operations. She also went blind for about three months in that period, Migils said.The seventh of seven children, Anastacia is wheelchair-bound and needs help to use the bathroom and to eat. She communicates well and is aware of her surroundings.According to Caroline Taylor of Inclusive Education South Africa, an NGO which advocates for the right of all children to access education, Anastacia s battle dates back to 2010 when she was assessed at Lentegeur Special School. Earlier this year, an email was sent to the Western Cape Education Department s Specialised Education Support asking for intervention on Anastacia s behalf and others who have been ignored, Education spokesman Paddy Attwell said: Children with disabilities requiring low levels of support may attend an ordinary school equipped to provide this form of support.Special schools accommodate learners requiring high levels of support.&quot;He said the department was aware of Anastacia plight. Our special education staff have arranged an observation period for her at a special school for intellectually disabled in Mitchells Plain. Unfortunately, she has physical and intellectual disabilities.The school will admit Anastacia next year. [email&#160;protected] @NoloyisoMtembu
