Cape Town - JP Smith, the man whose name has become synonymous with the City of Cape Town's safety and security portfolio, narrowly escaped the axe and will be part of a new super mayoral committee in the new year, sources close to the DA's federal executive have revealed. The federal executive holds the DA accountable through policies and can legally bind the party on all matters, according to the DA s federal constitution. The retention of Smith as a mayoral committee member is a significant move by Mayor Patricia de Lille who is gearing up to announce a new-look mayco to complement a new organisational structure in the city. The mayco reshuffle will see at least three new so-called super mayco positions created which will give the incumbents major influence over key portfolios with added responsibilities. Three support directorates have been established beneath these super mayco positions as well as four area-based portfolios with oversight over service delivery in each of the city's four areas. Smith, who has been involved in the city s safety and security portfolio for 10 years, first as chairman of the committee and later as mayco member, has in recent months been rumoured to be surplus to requirements in De Lille s new Organisational Development Transformation Plan (ODTP) stemming from clashes he was involved in within the city s DA caucus. The internal caucus battles have led Smith to fall out of favour with De Lille and sources had indicated that he would have moved to a less influential portfolio or be removed altogether when De Lille reshuffles her committee.The ODTP was adopted in August and is expected to take effect on January 1. De Lille is expected to announce her new committee early next month.Following a recent federal executive meeting, the Weekend Argus has it on good authority that amid public outcry which included petitions in support of Smith, that he will be retained as safety and security head. But his portfolio will also include additional areas of responsibility including health, social development and community services.It had earlier been speculated that Smith would have been charged with heading one of the four new area-based management portfolios while mayco member for social development Suzette Little would have taken over safety and security. With De Lille said to be vying for the premiership when Helen Zille s term ends in 2019, party members believed those close to De Lille were positioning themselves as possible mayoral candidates to succeed her.Another two close confidants of De Lille - Brett Herron, mayco member for transport and Xanthea Limberg, member for corporate services who both hail from De Lille s former Independent Democrats Party - are expected to take up the other super committee posts, alongside Smith.De Lille told the Weekend Argus that she could not comment on the reshuffle until an official announcement is made in January.DA federal executive chairman James Selfe would not be drawn into commenting on decisions made at its last meeting, while Smith declined to comment on his future.Herron s portfolio would include existing responsibilities - transport planning and urban integration -but also business and investment.Limberg would absorb responsibilities contained in the traditional utility services and human settlements portfolios including energy, informal settlements, water, electricity and waste services.At least two newcomers are expected on the new committee - portfolio chairwoman for social development and early childhood development Raelene Arendse has reportedly been earmarked for the post of corporate services while finance portfolio chairman Stuart Diamond is to head assets and services.
