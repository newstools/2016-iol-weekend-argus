Cape Town - An inquiry into dealings at the SABC is expected to resume in a little more than three weeks with testimony from two of the broadcasters' former board chairpersons who have been fingered as Hlaudi Motsoeneng s enablers.Parliament s ad hoc committee concluded proceedings for the year on Thursday after having called numerous witnesses after sitting for seven days.Former board chairpersons Ellen Tshabalala and Dr Ben Ngubane are high up on the list of witnesses to be called when proceedings resume next year.Witnesses who testified before the committee described the former chairpersons of the board as having been very favourable to Motsoeneng.Tshabalala was chairperson in July 2014 when Motsoeneng was appointed chief operating officer in defiance of the public protector s report which questioned his prior appointments without a matric certificate and recommended disciplinary action.Former group chief executive Lulama Mokhobo told the committee that even during Ngubane s tenure as board chairperson, back in 2011, Motsoeneng enjoyed special treatment and was even allowed to sit in on board meeting even though he was an ordinary member of the staff .On Thursday the committee s chairman, Vincent Smith, said they had been able to reach Ngubane, who had made himself available availed for January 10, but they were still trying to reach Tshabalala to secure a date. However they hoped to start with the both former chairpersons when they resumed.He said by January 15 a draft report should be presented to affected parties, who could then respond before a final report was submitted to Parliament by February 18. From November 15 when we were first got together we felt that this was a beginning of a marathon and I said we would be pushed to our limits, and such has been the case, he said.During the week shocking revelations were made to the committee over the week as Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi, board chairman Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe and four of the SABC eight journalists who were dismissed appeared before the committee.The committee heard, according to contributing editor Vuyo Mvoko, that SABC money was used to help fund the Gupta-owned ANN7 news channel.Shortly after their testimony, the SABC journalists received a threatening text message.Board chairman Professor Maguvhe denied ever knowing that there was any wrongdoing at the SABC and told the committee he would never resign.Minister Muthambi denied ever interfering with affairs at the SABC, claiming she inherited a troubled entity run by a dysfunctional board.Shortly after her testimony, board members accused the minister of having possibly misled them following the testimony of former board member Rachel Kalidass, contradicting many of Muthambi s assertions.Just as there have been surprises inside the committee, a lot of drama has been taking place outside.On Monday, a Western Cape High Court judgment ruled against Motsoeneng s latest appointment as group executive for corporate affairs and ruled he was not fit to hold any position at the SABC. And on Thursday, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) opened a case against Motsoeneng at the Brixton police station in Johannesburg.Outa chairman Wayne Duvenage says the charges related to Motsoeneng having misrepresented his qualification, his involvement in the MultiChoice deal where he is alleged to have pocketed R11 million and the irregular procurement deal relating to the upgrading of two studios which amounted to R39m.In a 19-paged affidavit deposed by Outa s legal representative, Lerissa Govender, the organisation lists in detail incidents where it alleges Motsoeneng broke the law. Outa submits that the continuous refusal to terminate Mr Motsoeneng s service amount to contempt of court. We submit that Mr Motsoeneng, as well as various board members and group executive members, committed racketeering and corruption. Through the power and authority bestowed upon them, they allowed Mr Motsoeneng to conclude contracts for which he had no authority, prejudicing the SABC and benefiting Mr Motsoeneng, says Govender.Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni says over the last two weeks MPs have demonstrated the kind of unity that has never been seen before. We are beginning to see significant parts of Parliament taking their role of oversight seriously and taking those in charge of state-owned institution to task, he says. We are seeing ANC MPs holding executives to account, which is a first. All of them have united in a manner that can only be beneficial. What is likely to happen after the committee hands over its report to Parliament is that criminal charges may be instituted against those found to be responsible for the chaos at the SABC.&quot;Hlaudi might be the next loser as he had become the primary source of power at the corporation and he had been doing so with total disregard for the laws and policies that governed that institution.&quot;Weekend Argus
