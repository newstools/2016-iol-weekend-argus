Cape Town - Wigs, lycra, fishnets and massive heels abounded at this year s MCQP s The Musical at Zip Zap Circus on Saturday.MCQP, formerly known as the Mother City Queer Project, has taken place in the city for the past 23 years with themes that encourage people to dress-up and have fun.Ian McMahon, a director of MCQP, said that when they first advertised this year s event as a Bollywood theme there was a backlash from a few people and they decided to change it to its current theme of &quot;The Musical&quot;..As people made their way through the brightly decorated entrance, costumes from the various musicals were immediately identifiable.They included Jesus Christ Superstar, Chicago, Grease, Moulin Rouge, Aladdin as well as Little Shop of Horrors.McMahon explained that the annual event draws thousands of people each year, and this year they expected between 6000 and 8000 people to walk through the gates.Even though the event is a celebration of gay pride, straight people have also latched on to the event. Straight people also love a good dress-up party, he said.He added that times have changed and people have changed.The venue, he explained also changes every few years, to provide variety.This year, patrons were able to enjoy five different music stages with over 60 different performers.Manila von Teez, runner-up in this year s SA s Got Talent, was also part of the acts on show for people to enjoy.Von Teez, who came dressed as Sandy from Grease, could be seen on the Cabaret stage along with a number of other drag stars. This event is a lot fun, said Von Teez.National and international DJs kept the beats blasting throughout the event.Candice Heyns, could be heard at the Sexy Groovy Love Dance Arena spinning her beats for the first time at this event. I was travelling Europe last year and I am bringing music with a more European flare. Although it is her first time playing at the event, she has attended the event in the past. There is always a fun crowd at this event. Kirsten Rhode, said it is the first time she attended the event and was very impressed.Paige Bantich, who also attended the event for this first time said she loved the theme.Another first-timer was Morgan Obermeyer. I love the vibe, the party and the people. Weekend Argus
