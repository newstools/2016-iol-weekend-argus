A raging blaze in Park Land had by yesterday evening destroyed more than 3 000 hectares of land, a majority of which carries large swathes of fynbos, in the Garden Route National Park.Firefighters on the scene last night said they would only be able to assess the scale the fire once the skies cleared. Speaking at the scene, Paul Gerber, managing director for Southern Cape Fire Protection (FPA) Association, said the fire ravage the area throughout the weekend. He said billowing smoke had obstructed their assessment. While the fire had lost momentum, he said, they expected to fight against bad conditions tomorrow. Gerber said firefighters need at least 40mm of rain to assist them. He said the slight drizzle over parts of the Garden Route, including Park Land, is doing little to help.Dirk Smit, incident commander for PFA, suspected that a short from a power line sparked the fire. He said a SANDF helicopter had been deployed to water-bomb the fire yesterday, while 185 firefighters and three tankers worked on the ground. It s a high-risk fire because there are communities around it, he said.Nandi Mgwadlamba, Garden Route National Park spokeswoman, said the park s fynbos had been damaged by the fire, which started on privately-owned land. Lauren Howard, Working on Fire spokeswoman, estimated the active fire line to be about 34km.Smit said there were also 14 other fires in the region, including at Waboomskraal, Haarlem, Kammanassie, Misgund farm; and in Mossel Bay.Wouter Jacobs, disaster management co-ordinator in the Eden District Municipality, said there had been 18 reported fires from Tuesday.Fortunately, only three were still active late yesterday, he said. It s difficult to tell how long the active fires are at the moment, he said.
