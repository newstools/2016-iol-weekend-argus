Cape Town - Despite five police killings in the past month in the Western Cape, the number of police deaths in the country, which is 79, is still lower than in the 2014/2015 financial year, according the annual report of the South African Police Service.In the 2009/2010 financial year, the national death toll of police officers was 101 and has continued to decrease, except for in the 2014/2015 financial year, when it increased to 86 from 77 in the previous financial year.Provincial police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said over the past month, one police officer was killed while on duty, while four others were killed off duty.National police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said the police are on record as having raised serious concerns regarding attacks on and the killing of officers. The situation in the Western Cape, with members having been killed over the past few weeks, is indeed concerning. In fact, the acting national commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane has sanctioned dedicated task teams to investigate all cases where SAPS members have been attacked or killed to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. She said he recently, during interaction with Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula, made it clear the police safety strategy must be thoroughly implemented and sustained in order to reduce or negate police killings in the province.According to the SAPS annual report for the 2015/2016 financial year, a back-to-basics police safety plan has been developed to strengthen and enhance the safety and operational readiness of SAPS members .The report says: The back-to-basics approach adopted by the South African Police Service focuses on every member of the SAPS and reverts to the basics of policing when performing functional policing duties or responding to incidents of crime. It adds that of the 79 police killings nationally, 34 were killed while on duty with 45 while off duty.The report says an analysis of the incidents where members were killed on duty indicated that most members were murdered when attending to complaints or during the apprehension and searching of suspects .The report also states that the 45 members who were killed while off duty were mainly victims of crimes such as hijackings and robbery.Dr Johan Burger of the Institute of Security Studies said it was clear there had been a decrease in police killings; however, the number of police killed in a short period of time makes it seem high.He said even though it could be assumed police officers are killed for their firearms, this is not the main reason. However, the obtaining of the firearm from the police officer is a bonus for the perpetrators. Be careful not to create the impression that criminals kill for guns. Burger said police officers were trained to protect themselves and the training over the years had improved. There is a lot of effort put into the training over the past few years. However, he said it was up to the police officers to apply their training and remained alert at all times.Weekend Argus
