Cape Town The family of well-known UWC council chairman Brian Williams was hijacked on Friday. Police moved swiftly to arrest two suspects after Cape Town advocate Nathan Williams and his one year-old daughter were hijacked off the N7, near the Cape Town Ostrich Farm. Williams was taking his daughter to the Ostrich farm for visit and was driving on Van Schoorsdrift road when he was approached by two men, both armed with bricks, and one with a gun. He was forced out of his vehicle and the attackers demanded the keys. My daughter was strapped in her car seat at the back and I begged them to give me my child. First they refused but when they wouldn t start the car they asked me to start it and in return gave me the child who was screaming . In less than an hour after the police were alerted with the help of nearby residents members, the suspects, aged 23 and 24 years, were apprehended. The police were incredible. As soon as they sent out information to their network, they were receiving leads that the vehicle was being seen in Monte Vista and later Elsies River and a team was dispatched. Soon afterwards the suspects were arrested. I gave the information to the police at about 12.45pm and by 1.05pm information was coming through that the suspects were arrested. I was blown away by the level of service the police rendered. Here was a team of people who sacrificed spending time with their own families during the holidays to help us. I was also offered trauma counselling he said. The vehicle and all the belongings were recovered. Brian Williams, who is the father to advocate Williams, praised the police officers for their action and said it showed that the police were capable of doing good work. The action also highlighted the co-operation between police and residents. Police spokeswomen, Noloyiso Rwexana, said a case of hijacking was being investigated and the suspects would appear in the Atlantis Magistrate s Court on December 28. Weekend Argus
