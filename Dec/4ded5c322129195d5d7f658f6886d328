During an interview with The Sunday Independent on Saturday, Dlamini said the federation stood by its pronouncement that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should succeed Zuma as president of the party and country. The central executive committee (CEC) will indeed meet the ANC to discuss its position, which led to it not recalling President Zuma after the national executive committee meeting. I cannot confirm the date, but the CEC will decide on it, Dlamini said.Asked what prompted Cosatu to defy the ANC which has consistently warned its structures and allies to desist from pronouncing on the party s succession debate, Dlamini said: This debate has been going on for some time. Therefore we decided to pronounce that Ramaphosa must be the next president of the ANC and the country. &quot;This is because some comrades have consistently been engaged in issues of succession by pronouncing their preferred candidate to succeed Zuma.&quot; The Cosatu president also hit out at his opponents who have previously labelled him as a Zuma puppet. I m not Zuma s puppet. I respect him as my president therefore the allegations cease to exist. &quot;The comrades who say they want to isolate the Cosatu president are doing so because they want to push a certain agenda. They are trying to blackmail me to push their own interests.&quot;Cosatu takes collective decisions. Therefore anybody who attempts to subject us to factionalism will not succeed, said the Cosatu boss. It is indeed true that the ANC is faced with challenges. We therefore support a call for unity because we are part of the (tripartite) alliance, Dlamini emphasised.The Sunday Independent
