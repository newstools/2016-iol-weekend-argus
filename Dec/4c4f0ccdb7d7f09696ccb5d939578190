Cape Town - The inquiry into the SABC board s one-man show has exposed a corporation run by a dysfunctional board and which is plagued by irregular expenditures running into hundreds of millions of rand.After sitting for three days, Parliament s ad hoc committee heard shocking evidence from former board members and executive managers who painted a picture of disarray: from ministerial interference by Communications Minister Faith Muthambi - who was accused of being &quot;too close to the action&quot; - to the bullying of board members who dared to disagree with Hlaudi Motsoeneng.The inquiry has not been without drama after proceedings in Parliament got off to a shaky start on Wednesday when an SABC entourage led by board chair Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe and Motsoeneng walked out.The following day Maguvhe was a no-show.The committee was told by those who testified that a lack of proper direction from the board led to financial mismanagement, and with no policies in place to guard against instances of irregular expenditure, the SABC would run at a loss.Three officials from the auditor-general s office testified to the worrying state of affairs in the finances of the SABC following an audit last year.Corporate executive officer Alice Muller told the committee that R141million in irregular expenditure could not be audited because of the unavailability of supporting documents.Former board member Krish Naidoo also mentioned an instance where the board had to write off R2 billion in unclaimed subscription fees due to a lack of policies.Former group executive for risk and governance, Itani Tseisi, told the committee a lack of financial strategy threatened the sustainability of the SABC. He said the future for the SABC would be one of foreseeable losses. When asked to describe the last three chairpersons of the board - Dr Ben Ngubane, Ellen Tshabalala and Maguvhe - who were all said to favour Motsoeneng, Tseisi described them as a disaster. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwanazi also testified to incidents of irregular and wasteful expenditure, which included a salary increment bill which ran up to R29m, approved by Motsoeneng.The former board members told the committee that many decisions taken by Motsoeneng, including a 90percent local content strategy, and R50000 bonuses to local musicians, were not approved by the board.Mkhwanazi told the committee the SABC had defied all remedial action, which highlighted the undermining of her office by the SABC.Board members also confirmed how the remedial action recommended in the report was disregarded and an internal process instituted which served only to justify the appointment of Motsoeneng as chief operating officer, an appointment which had been flagged as irregular by the report, and later unlawful by the Western Cape High Court.On Saturday the public protector's spokesman, Oupa Segwale, said the public protector's office was looking into ways to ensure that the remedial actions were implemented. The public protector will soon be meeting the attorneys of record to come up with the way forward, which may include requesting the court to make remedial action an order of the court, he said.On Monday former human resources chief, Jabulani Mabaso, as well as former technology head Sipho Masinga, former labour relations general manager Madiwe Nkosi and four journalists representing the so-called SABC eight are expected to appear before the committee.The SABC came in for criticism in July when it fired eight journalists - Foeta Krige, Suna Venter, Krivani Pillay, Thandeka Gqubule, Busisiwe Ntuli, Lukhanyo Calata, Vuyo Mvoko and Jacques Steenkamp -for speaking out against the broadcaster s policy to not show footage of violent protests.The committee resolved to call Maguvhe to appear on Tuesday after issuing a summons, but it remains unclear if he will attend.Weekend Argus
