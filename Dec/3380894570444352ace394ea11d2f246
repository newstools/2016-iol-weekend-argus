Cape Town Family, friends and colleagues packed the Claremont Baptist Church to pay their last respects at the memorial service to city politician and former journalist Steven Otter, who was killed last week. Last Friday, Otter was murdered in a Harfield Village home during a robbery in the early hours of the morning. A number people entered the church barefoot in tribute to Otter who was often seen walking around without shoes. A message from Otter s brother, Thomas Otter, who was unable to attend the service was read to congregation. This is a day of celebration for a life that was lived to the full. Steven would not want us to be cynical about the circumstances surrounding his passing, but rather to continue to bridge the gaps that exist between people. Natalie Williams, Otter s fianc&eacute; said he was a gentle and kind soul. He came into my life when I was completely broken and showed me so much love. He radiated love. He made everybody feel loved. He had a special relationship with everybody. Weekend Argus
