Cape Town - As traffic officials warn there will be zero tolerance of drunk driving on Saturday night, New Year s Eve revellers have a variety of safer options. New Year s Eve is one of the busiest for Uber. But some customers might be concerned about the surge in pricing, the multiple that Uber charges during high demand, could mean they have a hefty bill. During peak demand, the dynamic pricing algorithm automatically increases prices to encourage more driver-partners to cater for the demand, said Samantha Allenberg, Uber Africa spokesperson. Uber X, Uber XL and Uber Black all make use of the same algorithm based on supply and demand. The MyCiTi bus will be operating as the city has extended the buses' hours to assist party-goers. Buses T01 from the Waterfront to Table View, 107 heading to Camps Bay, and the 217 to Melkbosstrand will leave from Table View and make their last trips at 1am except for the 214 Parklands bus, which will leave from Table View at 2am. Only these four bus routes have extended hours. See MyCiTi.org.za for details.Numerous taxi services will be available at varying costs. Ludmilla Ackermann, a senior booking agent at Sport24Hrs Taxis and Shuttle, said: There will be 70 taxis. &quot;We expect 1 000 calls from 6pm to 6am. We do not take pre-bookings for New Year s Eve.
