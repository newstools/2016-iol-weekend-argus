Carla Bernado looks at ten Fidel Castro quotes which she believes embodies the man who helped liberate South Africa.Fidel Castro, the revolutionary Cuban leader, has died at age 90.A controversial figure until the end, Castro was steadfast in his condemnation of the United States and its allies, vehemently against the ills of capitalism, and passionate about the progress of his and the rest of the global South s people.I hope, that in the 10 quotes, I bring across parts of the man that helped my country, South Africa - and my continent - achieve liberation.1. They talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America? 2. I think that a man should not live beyond the age when he begins to deteriorate, when the flame that lighted the brightest moment of his life has weakened. 3. We must establish a new world order based on justice, on equity, and on peace. 4. ...Let us be more generous, more jointly responsible, more humane. Let South Africa become a model of a more just, more humane, future world. If you can achieve it, all of us will be able to.5. Capitalism has neither the capacity, nor the morality, nor the ethics to solve the problems of poverty. 6. We don t need the empire to give us any presents. (Castro on US President Barack Obama s visit to Cuba)7. My idea, as the whole world knows, is that the capitalist system now doesn t work either for the United States or the world, driving it from crisis to crisis, which are each time more serious. 8. ...our country is not just Cuba; our country is also humanity. 9. I don't think anyone has been slandered more than the Jews. 10. History will absolve me. * Bernardo is Independent Media s Group Social Media ManagerIOL
