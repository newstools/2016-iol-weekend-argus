Siyabonga KalipaCape Town - Tutus, colourful wigs and butterfly wings all lined up at the start of this year s Color Run at Green Point Track.The track was filled with people eager for the run to begin. Some took pictures while others were covering themselves with a variety of coloured powders.About 15 000 people participated in the event, and had to be divided into large groups, each cheered on their way by a large crowd.Out on the road, there were points with different colours where bystanders smothered those passing with coloured powder. A marimba band played music on the route.Throughout the race people would stop and take pictures of themselves shaded in a myriad colours.Charlotte Bruyns said it was her first time doing the Color Run, and that it was fun for her.She said she was definitely coming back next year.Another first-time participant, Naufhad Khan, said it was more than a race for him because it got people from different races together enjoying themselves. It s bridging the divide, and I wish something like this could happen more often as it s good for our country , Khan said.Andisiwe Dondashe, who was taking part for the second time, said she loved this one more than the first. I loved the fact that there was music in every colour spot, and that the were no stampedes this year. But I won t be coming back next year because it is hard to wash out the different colours from my hair. Weekend Argus
