Cape Town - Mitchells Plain matric pupil Wade Arends &#x201C;had a death wish&#x201D;. He longed to be reunited with his dead father and brother.This weekend he was gunned downed by gangsters not far from his home in Rocklands.Arends died on Friday night after gangsters shot him at a shop in Arabian Street.He celebrated his 18th birthday in July and was a Westridge High pupil preparing to write his final exam.Imraan Gafieldien, 24, was also killed in the same shooting. A third man, Aamien Soeker, 25, was shot and is recovering in hospital.This was the third shooting in Rocklands this week, which residents blame on a gang war between rivals the Americans and School Boys shedding blood over territory and the drugs trade.Police arrested two suspects after the latest killings.Joan Arends, who had cared for her grandson, Wade, since he was a toddler, told Weekend Argus on Saturday that the quiet teenager had longed to be with his father, who died three years ago of a heart attack. He had also missed his older brother, Wayne Leigh Arends, who was 24 when gangsters killed him in January.&#x201C;His dream came true. He wanted to be with his father and brother. He cut himself off from everybody,&#x201D; said Mrs Arends. &#x201C;When he came home from school he used to go to his room and close the door. He wouldn&#x2019;t start a conversation. He was depressed. He moved into his (dead) brother&#x2019;s room.&#x201C;He was crying two weeks ago. He asked me who will be there for him if myself and my husband were not there.&#x201D;She said she had raised her two grandchildren after their parents divorced. &#x201C;I raised Wade and his brother when his mother remarried. They were toddlers. We sacrificed a lot for them.&#x201D;Her grandson had &#x201C;been through a lot this year&#x201D;, she said.He had been robbed of his cellphone five times on his way to school. His brother had died. &#x201C;On top of that he had to write his matric exams. He couldn&#x2019;t handle it,&#x201D; said his grandmother.Her daughter, Natasha Paulse, who lives in Muizenberg, said her nephew had become &#x201C;very withdrawn after his brother died&#x201D;.&#x201C;It was hard to reach him. He was depressed. He went through a lot in a short space of time. It was tough because he was still so young.&#x201D;Shaakirah Gafieldien, the sister of Imraan, the second victim of Friday night&#x2019;s shooting, said: &#x201C;Imraan went to the shop to buy cigarettes.&#x201C;We heard a shot go off. We thought it was fireworks. But then people came to tell us Imraan was shot.&#x201C;We went outside and saw him take his last breath. My brother wasn&#x2019;t part of a gang. We don&#x2019;t know why gangsters are shooting innocent people.&#x201D;Her mother, Sukayna Gafieldien, was at the Salt River home of one of her daughters at the time of the shooting . &#x201C;They phoned me. I was shocked. I didn&#x2019;t expect to lose my son in this way. He was my breadwinner.&#x201D;Her 16-year-old grandson witnessed the shooting. &#x201C;I was at the shop and when I walked away I saw three of them (allegedly gangsters). They shot my uncle. The bullet went past my head.&#x201C;They shot Wade and he tried to get away. He was still talking to us. He told us to tell his grandmother that they shot him.&#x201D;Gafieldien was buried on Saturday according to Muslim rites while Arends will be buried next Saturday.Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said the shooting was being investigated.Two suspects, aged 18 and 24, are due to appear in court in Mitchells Plain tomorrow on charges of murder and attempted murder.He said police were also investigating two other shootings earlier in the week. Last Sunday afternoon an 18-year-old man had been shot and killed. On Thursday night another man had been shot dead and two others injured.Traut said: &#x201C;The motive for the violence in the area is yet to be established.&#x201D; Weekend Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
