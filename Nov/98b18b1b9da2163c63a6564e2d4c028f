Cape Town - Instead of spending weeks paging through admission requirements to determine the right degree programme to study, high school pupils can now find all the information they need via a swipe and a tap on their cellphones.Thanks to Gradesmatch, an app developed by a group of young innovators, pupils will not have to travel to university campuses or read through each prospectus - they can access all information relevant to their career choice from one app.UCT graduates Rudzani Mulaudzi, Lebogang Diale and Unathi September came up with a startup business which developed Gradesmatch.They did so in response to an incident at the University of Johannesburg in January 2012 in which Gloria Sekwena, the mother of zxprospective student, Kgositsile Sekwena, was killed during a stampede while queuing to find placement for her son. The woman s death put the spotlight on university application and admission processes and the large numbers of applicants who walk in during registration week.The incident shocked authorities.Diale, who is responsible for finance and strategy at Gradesmatch, said they sought to create a central place where pupils would get career guidance, admission requirements, funding and mentoring information.The app requires pupils to register their favourite subjects and answer questions about their personality traits and career goals; it then analyses this information and produces career choices, qualification programmes and lists universities that offer them.On entering their subject marks in the app, pupils get an admission point score for each subject. It also compares this score to university-required scores.Diale said from as early as Grade 8, pupils can benefit from the app by searching and matching their information to see how to get to their career goals and what would be required of them to gain admission.He said pupils often found themselves choosing subjects that did not take them to the career they dream of.[email&#160;protected]Weekend Argus
