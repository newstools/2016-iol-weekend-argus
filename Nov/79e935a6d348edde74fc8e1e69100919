Parliament - Investigations into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#x2019;s role in setting up the so-called &#x201C;rogue unit&#x201D; at Sars, a surveillance unit which allegedly spied on politicians, are far down the line, says embattled National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams.&#x201C;The status of the rogue unit investigation, I&#x2019;ve been advised that investigations are at an advanced stage,&#x201D; Abrahams told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.He dropped fraud charges against Gordhan on Monday, executing a U-turn in a case that had rattled markets and drawn accusations of political meddling.He confirmed that Gordhan was still being investigated for his role in setting up the surveillance unit at Sars a decade ago, when Gordhan headed the revenue service.Gordhan was first questioned about this in February by the police but in August ignored a follow-up summons, saying he had done nothing wrong.After facing a marathon grilling on how the decision to press charges in an &#x201C;unwinnable&#x201D; case was taken, Abrahams also promised on Friday to hand over to Parliament the full summary of evidence relating to the charges against Gordhan and former top Sars officials.The summary could be key to establishing whether there was any evidence before the prosecutors justifying the pressing of criminal charges in a matter - the early retirement of former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay - that is common practice in the public service.The National Prosecuting Authority boss, who announced the decision to prosecute the three men just before Gordhan was to present a critical Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, only to withdraw the charges at the 11th hour, said the summary of evidence would &#x201C;deal with&#x201D; the question of intent.Abrahams said he had decided to withdraw the case against Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and Pillay after representations from Freedom Under Law, the Helen Suzman Foundation and the two ex-Sars officials brought to light an opinion from Vlok Symington, Sars deputy director of law, advising that it was in order for the revenue service to pay an early retirement penalty on Pillay&#x2019;s behalf.The charge of fraud against the three would have required the prosecution to prove they intended misleading Sars into believing it was obliged to pay the penalty, but the legal opinion showed that they had acted in good faith, dealing a fatal blow to the case.Abrahams was also asked to explain why he had interrogated the basis for the charges and then chosen to withdraw them only after making his announcement that the three would be charged, when he should have known the announcement would cause enormous damage to the economy and reputation of the country.But Abrahams continued to insist that there had been a prima facie case at the time of the decision to prosecute, and he had been &#x201C;satisfied&#x201D; on the basis of the facts that the prosecution should proceed.However, when the Symington legal opinion came to light, he had been &#x201C;deeply concerned&#x201D;.&#x201C;And I wanted to know, where does this memorandum come from, how was this memorandum overlooked?&#x201D; Abrahams said.He was also investigating whether it had been deliberately withheld from him.Abrahams said that in light of the memorandum, he had been obliged to order further investigations to establish its veracity and it was on the basis of these that he had ultimately taken the decision to withdraw the charges just days before the three were to appear in court.It appears these further investigations may have been what prompted the Hawks to corner Symington at the Sars offices in a bid to make him sign a statement relating to his 2009 legal opinion on the issue.He has alleged that he was held captive there by the Hawks, in the presence of Sars commissioner Tom Moyane&#x2019;s bodyguard.The Freedom Under Law organisation and the Helen Suzman Foundation have written to President Jacob Zuma asking him to suspend Abrahams, North Gauteng director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi and head of the priority crimes litigation unit Torie Pretorius, pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.The EFF and ANC heavyweight Mathews Phosa seek to have Abrahams disbarred.Abrahams, meanwhile, said he saw no reason to apologise.Political Bureau
