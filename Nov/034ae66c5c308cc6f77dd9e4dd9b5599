Durban - &#x201C;I apologised to my mother. I said, Janet is dead.&#x201D;That was part of the chilling statement given in court this week by former jockey Graham Gregorowski, 29, who broke down in tears as he gave graphic detail of the night when his partner, Janet Scott, died at his home in Shongweni three weeks ago on October 22.He also told the court how he tried to commit suicide after trying to resuscitate her.Appearing for formal bail application in the Pinetown Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Tuesday, charged with the murder of Scott, 54, Gregorowski recalled the hours leading up to his arrest on Saturday morning.He also claimed that he suffers from bipolar disorder and had stopped taking his medication. He said he would be pleading not guilty.The Scott family are well-known in South African horse racing circles. Janet&apos;s brother, Rob Scott, is a racing director of the Racing Association and head of horse racing television channel Tellytrack racing and Phumelela&#x2019;s marketing and media division. Another brother, Colin, is a KwaZulu-Natal based racehorse trainer.The Scott family arrived in force for the hearing, as did family for Gregorowski.After his admission that he had been in a relationship with Scott for three years, the court heard Scott lived with her father and had arrived at the jockey&#x2019;s residence earlier on the day of her death.The couple and Gregorowski&#x2019;s housemate had shared dinner and wine, before he and the housemate left for a pub.Gregorowski said he had been involved in a fight with a third party at the pub before walking home by himself. When he arrived home, he heard Scott showering, so had waited outside until she let him in, shortly after which the couple started arguing.&#x201C;I had been knocked around at the pub. I had blood on my nose and mouth. I wanted to get to the bathroom. I had to get Janet off my back,&#x201D; said Gregorowski.He said Scott had attacked him three times and he had retaliated by pushing and giving her a &#x201C;backhand - I slapped her in the face&#x201D;, before shutting himself in the bathroom.&#x201C;I carried on until I had finished. When I opened the door, her head was turned to the side, awkwardly positioned. She was bleeding from her nose.At this point Gregorowski broke down in tears, saying, &#x201C;I called out her name, there was no response.&#x201D;He said he tried to resuscitate her, before dragging her to his bedroom.&#x201C;I tried to pick her up and take her to the bedroom, but I didn&apos;t succeed as I was wet from the shower. So I dragged her through to the room. I wanted to get her off the tiles and on to the carpet.&#x201D;Once there he said he tried resuscitation again and when this failed, he placed her on the bed and covered her with a blanket, after which he tried to commit suicide.&#x201C;I tried to slit my wrists with a knife... I also took an extension cable, hung it in my room and tried to hang myself. I must have blacked out. I woke up on the floor... hours later.&#x201D;Court was adjourned for the accused to compose himself. Once back on the stand, State prosecutor Nqobile Malinga grilled Gregorowski regarding injuries sustained by Scott. She said Scott&#x2019;s face had been &#x201C;so swollen and full of blood&#x201D; that she was unrecognisable.Malinga asked the accused about blood on the mattress, carpet, and in the passage, as well as blood spatter on the walls, adding that Scott&#x2019;s body had been bruised in a number of places, including her arms and thighs.Gregorowski said he suffered from bipolar disorder and had not been taking medication for the condition.During cross-examination, Malinga asked about their argument.Gregrowoski said Scott had accused him of planning to leave her for a younger woman.&#x201C;She accused me of having a relationship with a younger person and that I wanted to leave her. She could not accept that. I asked her to pack her bags and leave the next morning.&#x201D;Gregorowski said Scott&apos;s bruises could be accounted for when he dragged her to the bedroom. He said he had no recollection of blood spatter, but thought it could have come from his hands as he was spinning when he tried to hang himself.When Malinga questioned him on what happened when he woke up, he said he had gone outside and called his mother. &#x201C;I apologised to my mother, I said Janet is dead. I apologised and I cried.&#x201D;Gregorowski described the nature of their relationship as &#x201C;more of a companionship&#x201D;, although he did say, &#x201C;she was scared of losing me&#x201D;.When questioned further on his claim of suffering from bipolar, he said being off medication could make him manic.He said, &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen. I tried to hang myself twice and slit my wrists once. When I woke up, I had to see the whole scene again, Janet on the bed...&#x201D;Appearing for the defence, Ndu Thuketana asked that the bail hearing be adjourned until he could access further information regarding his client&#x2019;s bipolar disorder diagnosis. Thuketana told the court he had met the accused for the first time before the bail hearingMagistrate Terrence Buthelezi adjourned the matter until November 16.
