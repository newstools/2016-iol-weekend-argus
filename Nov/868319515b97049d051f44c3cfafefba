Cape Town - At least 800 boxes of illegal fireworks have been confiscated by the city&#x2019;s law enforcement officials in the run-up to the annual Guy Fawkes celebration.Twelve official sites have been approved by the city where revellers can let off firecrackers, smoke bombs and ground spinners.Some of the areas that law enforcement officers will keep watch over include the Wesfleur sports field in Atlantis, the Swartklip sports complex in Mitchells Plain, Delft Central sports grounds, and Maiden&#x2019;s Cove parking area in Camps Bay.Cape Town&#x2019;s mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, said only those aged 16 and over could legally discharge fireworks and appealed to the public to use common sense on what he called &#x201C;arguably one of our most challenging days&#x201D;.&#x201C;We commit significant resources to overseeing proceedings at the approved fireworks sites, and it shows in the fact that we had no major incidents last year,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;While the city has a duty to ensure public safety, the public too has a duty to play their part.&#x201D;Firework displays have to stop by 11pm.Smith said metro police and law enforcement would be on hand to respond to complaints of fireworks being let off in residential areas.&#x201C;Last year, the metro police department alone received 309 complaints. In addition, law enforcement will step up operations to clamp down on illegal fireworks vendors,&#x201D; he said.Smith added that officials would also keep a lookout for what he called the &#x201C;ominous tradition of smearing people with paint&#x201D; in some parts of the city on Guy Fawkes night.Last year, a Mitchells Plain resident said they were scared to walk home as they risked being smeared with paint by pupils.The resident added that taxi drivers were also concerned about their minibuses being smeared with paint and damaged.It has become a tradition to carry around sand and paint, and, when Guy Fawkes falls on a school day, many stay at home to avoid being splattered.After last year&#x2019;s paint throwing, Education MEC Debbie Schafer said: &#x201C;Bullying tactics and intimidatory behaviour are simply unacceptable, and should be condemned by the community.&#x201D;How to protect your pets from the loud bangsPet owners are getting ready for a low point of the year, with the loud bangs of Guy Fawkes fireworks leaving many animals shivering wrecks.Jessica Perrins, of the Animal Welfare Society of Stellenbosch, advised pet owners to stay home with their animals on Saturday night. If you have to go out, place your animals indoors in a secure room. &#x201C;During stressful times animals like familiarity, so place their bedding and blankets around them, and provide them with plenty of toys and treats to keep them occupied,&#x201D; she said. Draw the curtains, secure any exits and play the TV or radio to draw their attention away from the noise of the fireworks.Perrins said that if owners knew their pets responded badly, they should consider visiting a vet to prescribe a sedative. She said owners must make sure pets were easily identifiable, with an ID disc on their collar or a microchip, in case they ran away from home.Where to enjoy the funDesignated areas to let off fireworks: Table View beachfront.
