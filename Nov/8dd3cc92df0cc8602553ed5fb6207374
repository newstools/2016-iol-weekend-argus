Cape Town - Stellenbosch singer Tebogo Louw is in the running to be crowned winner of popular TV reality show Idols SA. Tonight he will perform the popular Song of the Year, Nomvula, by Nathi Mankanyi and DJ Coffee s Superman.He is up against Noma Khumalo and Thami Shobede, both from KwaZulu, for the top award.It s the penultimate live show and the top three have been in the studio recording their singles and shooting their cover photos. The major victory for me so far has been going through the Top 16 - something I could not achieve before. I crossed the barrier and that s been my greatest motivation, he said.Louw has his heart set on giving his best performance yet and, despite a tight schedule of rehearsals and mentoring, has been working hard with vocal workouts. I don t allow any distractions. I don t even think about who I am up against - my focus is on how I can up my game - I want to give the best of me. Louw s journey from singing at clubs and theatres in Stellenbosch and Cape Town to the Idols SA stage has not been easy. He was eliminated twice before from the competition and was advised to give up on singing. But this time round, his performances of Michael Jackson s You Are Not Alone and Lengoma by South Africa s Zahara have won him a vote of confidence from fans and the competition s judges.Louw said he had learnt a lot about the music industry and had identified big opportunities for himself, and hoped to launch his debut album in time for Christmas.The show has launched the careers of many musicians, from Heinz Winkler to Elvis Blue, Jody Williams and Khaya Mthethwa. I am grateful to my supporters across the country and in my home town, and my family, for their support and for their votes. Louw does not plan to cut ties with Khayamnandi but for now he plans to move to Joburg to concentrate on growing his music career. The finals will be held at the Carnival City in Gauteng next Sunday.Weekend Argus
