Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court is due to make a ruling on whether Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan - then Commissioner of South African Revenue Services (Sars) - had powers to fire a white employee for calling his supervisor a &#x201C;k****r&#x201D;.This unfolded on July 27, 2007, when Jacobus Johannes Kruger, an employee at Sars said: &#x201C;Ek kan nie verstaan hoe &apos;* k****r dink nie&#x201D; (&#x201C;I don&apos;t know how a k****r thinks&#x201D;).According to evidence in the internal disciplinary hearing, these comments were made after Kruger had a heated argument with his supervisor, Amos Mboweni.He appeared before a disciplinary inquiry on August 31, 2007.At the disciplinary hearing, Kruger pleaded guilty. He submitted a case in mitigation based on stress from which he said he was suffering at that time.A plea bargain was apparently struck in terms of which the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry, an independent person drawn from a dispute resolution organisation, found him guilty as charged, imposed a final written warning, suspended him without pay for 10 days, and directed him to receive counselling.However, Gordhan overturned the ruling and imposed a sentence of dismissal on October 3.Kruger challenged the dismissal at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), on the basis that the dismissal was substantively and procedurally unfair. He further argued that the commissioner did not have the powers to substitute the sanction of the chairperson with dismissal. Sars argued that because it is entrusted with the responsibility to collect tax from the public, the offence was very serious and it would raise eyebrows if he were to receive a mere final written warning.The CCMA then ruled in favour of Kruger and ordered Sars to reinstate him subject to the original ruling.Aggrieved by that decision, Sars approached the Labour Court.In the Labour Court, Sars argued that reinstatement was inappropriate because it could not be expected to retain an employee who had lost their trust and confidence because of his insubordinate, racist, derogatory and abusive conduct.Kruger argued that Sars did not have any form of discretion to deviate from the chairperson&#x2019;s sanction. Also, that the award by the CCMA was reasonable as Sars acted ultra vires (beyond the powers) since there was no justification for the deviation from its own policies and procedures, including the collective agreement.The Labour Court ruled in favour of Kruger.Sars then appealed to the Labour Appeal Court and again failed, which prompted them to approach the Concourt.In August this year, Sars argued that their application for leave to appeal against the Labour Appeal Court decision was raising a constitutional issue and that it was in the interests of justice to grant leave because termination of an employment contract for racism in the public sector is an important constitutional matter.It also said that there are reasonable prospects of success on appeal.However, Kruger has opposed the application, arguing that the appeal should be dismissed because Sars had waived its right to appeal.He also said that the application for appeal did not raise any constitutional issue or other connected matter saying it would not be in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal as there are no prospects of success.Judgment is expected to be delivered on Tuesday.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
