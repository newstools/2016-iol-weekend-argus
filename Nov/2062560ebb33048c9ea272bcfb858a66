Cape Town - A horrific attack, which ended in the death of a 33-year-old Tafelsig woman, went to the Western Cape High Court on Friday.Belinda Bastiaan lived for 47 days after her eyes were gouged out of their sockets and she was left for dead in a pool of blood in her home.Despite medical intervention, including neurosurgery for an intracranial haemorrhage, she died in hospital.Her widower, Steve Bastiaan, stands accused of her murder, as well as rape and aggravated assault.When Bastiaan appeared in court for a pre-trial conference on Friday, Judge Robert Henney asked whether the parties had considered negotiating a plea bargain. He was told the State and the defence had agreed to discuss the issue.The case was postponed to enable them to do so.According to the charge sheet, Bastiaan had a pending assault case against him after he allegedly beat his wife in May last year. In that case, he was released on bail and ordered to have no contact with her and to move to Elsies River. He was also prohibited from entering Mitchells Plain.Despite this, Bastiaan visited his friend Marlyn Ludick in Mitchells Plain on June 20 that year. His wife and children were also there and the family left together.The following day, Ludick received a call asking him to fetch Bastiaan&#x2019;s children.She sent her daughter to the house but there was no answer.Belinda was eventually found inside the house, with her eyes gouged out.She was still alive and was admitted to Groote Schuur Hospital, where she underwent surgery to her eyes and brain. She never regained consciousness and died on August 7.The State claims it has forensic evidence linking Bastiaan to the crime scene. Weekend Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
