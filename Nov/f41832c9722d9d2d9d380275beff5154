Johannesburg - The wealthy Gupta family, which has been accused of holding undue political sway over President Jacob Zuma, said on Thursday it would defend itself at a judicial inquiry.The carefully worded public protector report into alleged influence-peddling stopped short of saying crimes had been committed but said a judge must probe a scandal that has rattled markets and increased the risk of ratings downgrades.Titled &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D;, the 355-page report by previous Public Protector Thuli Madonsela listed several allegations against Zuma, the Guptas, two cabinet ministers and executives at state-owned firms. It did not reach conclusive findings.Three Indian-born Gupta brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - are accused of using their friendship with the president to influence cabinet appointments.Zuma denies granting undue influence to the brothers, who run a business empire from media to mining.They have denied seeking it, and will defend their corner at the planned inquiry, their lawyer, Gert van de Merwe, said.&#x201C;We will participate and we will participate comprehensively,&#x201D; he told eNCA television.&#x201C;I&apos;ve always said that if we apply for review of the report of the public protector, it will be on the basis that we&apos;ve not been afforded the opportunity to participate,&#x201D; he said.The Guptas, who refer to themselves in statements as the &apos;Gupta Family&apos;, were studying the report, he added.Zuma&apos;s office has said he is doing the same and reserves the right to challenge its findings in court.The report was released on Wednesday, hours after Zuma withdrew a court bid to delay its publication.Analysts said although the report did not carry a knock-out punch, it had piled even more pressure on Zuma to resign.
