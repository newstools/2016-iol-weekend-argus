Cape Town - Two former University of the Western Cape (UWC) council members walked out of court victorious on Friday after the institution&#x2019;s council withdrew their suspensions and expulsion and agreed to pay all the costs of their application for reinstatement.Former council chairman Professor Brian Williams was expelled and former president of the convocation Songezo Maqula was suspended by the council last November on allegations by the then student representative council that they had incited students during a #feesmustfall meeting at the campus on October 31 last year.The communication to the council members was sent during proceedings on Thursday after advocate Alec Freund, for Williams and Maqula, laid out the case before Judge Patrick Gamble on how the council had proceeded to act against the two without any grounds.An e-mail was sent from Lionel Egypt, director of conflict resolution, for Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc.In the communication Egypt wrote:&#x201D;Pursuant to my telephonic discussions held with the chair of council a few minutes ago, I confirm that we are instructed to settle the matter on the best possible basis for the UWC and the council.&#x201D;Egypt then proposed that the suspension and expulsion be withdrawn and that UWC tender the applicants&#x2019; costs, including the costs of two counsel.&#x201C;This will hopefully ensure that the court doesn&#x2019;t deliver a damning judgment in relation to the issues as discussed. I await your urgent further instructions,&#x201D; the UWC legal representative concluded.Before the council voted to throw in the towel, the packed courtroom heard how council members, despite caution, had gone ahead with the expulsion.Of the most damning evidence placed before the court were statements by council member Onkgopotse Tabane, who is said to have led the charge against the two.These included a statement attributed to him in which he said: &#x201D;Let (Williams) go and spend money to go to court; so that we create an atmosphere where we say to him because you are expelled, you are not allowed to be on the premises of the university.&#x201D;The court was also presented with another statement by Tabane in which he said &#x201D;(Williams and Maqula) must go and challenge that in court but they will be out of the university&#x201D;.The court also heard that one of the pieces of evidence presented by those alleging Williams and Maqula had incited students was a one-hour video, taken at a distance, which had no sound.Freund said there had been a &#x201C;pattern of misgovernance at the institution&#x201D;.This was noted by Judge Gamble, who stated that UWC had been cited previously by the courts.&#x201D;It concerns me that they are not interested in what the courts have to say. The track record of this particular council does not engender great hope that it will not happen again.&#x201D;He said he would deliver judgment before the council convened on December 1.Council chairman Mthunzi Mdwaba said after the decision to capitulate that&#x201D;in the interest of moving the university forward, the university council has withdrawn the expulsion of Brian Williams and the suspension of Songezo Maqula&#x201D;.Maqula said afterwards that he felt&#x201D;predominantly vindicated, because we knew we did nothing wrong&#x201D;. Williams said he was relieved, but still felt that &#x201C;the reputational damage that resulted from the actions of the UWC council has not been addressed&#x201D;.
