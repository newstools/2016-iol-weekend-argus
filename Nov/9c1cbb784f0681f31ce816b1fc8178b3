Cape Town - Police have intensified their hunt for three suspects who, with seven other young men, allegedly abducted and gang raped a 13-year-old girl.Seven of the 10 alleged rapists appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Friday in connection with the attack, which took place at three locations in Nyanga last Friday night.State prosecutor Nangamso Matta told the court the young victim - who had been abducted at gunpoint - had been able to identify her alleged attackers, aged between 18 and 20 years old.The seven accused were nabbed by police earlier this week. They have not yet pleaded in court and cannot be named. Each one of you faces a charge of rape, Magistrate Goolam Bawa told the group, who were close to tears as they stared straight ahead. It is a very serious offence which carries a possible sentence of life in prison if you were to be found guilty. One of the accused men burst into tears and glanced at his equally emotional family members seated in the public gallery.Prosecutor Matta said the victim had been walking home at 8pm on Robert Sobukwe Road last Friday when she was approached by one of the accused. Matta said the accused had pointed a gun at the girl and demanded she go with him. He took her to a shack in the area where he raped her. His friends were there and they took turns raping her. It is alleged the perpetrators took the girl to two more shacks in the area, where she was again sexually assaulted, before being released the following day. Goolam said the case would be remanded until Friday to give police time to track the three suspects who are still at large. The seven accused indicated they would appoint their own legal representatives. Emotions ran high when the group was led back to the holding cells. Why is this happening? a family member cried. What are we supposed to do? The woman, who left the court sobbing, was comforted by family members who were also weeping. [email&#160;protected]Weekend Argus
