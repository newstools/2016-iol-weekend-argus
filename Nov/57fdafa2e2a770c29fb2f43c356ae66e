Cape Town - A number of police officers are getting off lightly - with just verbal or written warnings - when breaking the law by not co-operating with investigations against them.This was recently revealed in Parliament when questions were asked about the police&#x2019;s co-operation with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) when it took up citizens&#x2019; complaints against them.Ipid&#x2019;s investigations include incidents where citizens died while in police custody, and corruption or extortion.DA MP Zak Mbhele asked Police Minister Nathi Nhleko for statistics on the matter.Nhleko&#x2019;s response to Parliament revealed that Ipid opened 41 cases against police officers in 2015/16 for non-cooperation, 60 cases in the 2014/15 financial year, 65 in 2013/14 and 127 in 2012/13 . Oft these 293 cases, only 32 departmental convictions were finalised, according to Nhleko&#x2019;s response. A total of 26 written and six verbal warnings were issued for the same cases.The minister&#x2019;s response did not confirm if there were any criminal charges or court cases pending against police officers for non-cooperation.Mbhele said it was &#x201C;telling that there was no mention of criminal charges&#x201D;.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s completely shocking,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The majority of cases just vanish into thin air. Officers faced no real consequences for obstructing Ipid investigations&#x201D;.He said the problem was that Ipid investigators were former police officers &#x201C;who don&#x2019;t want to burn bridges&#x201D;. The police minister also appoints the Ipid director.Mbhele said: &#x201C;Ipid is too scared to be antagonistic towards the police. It&#x2019;s well known in police culture that they try to protect each other. &#x201C;It means they can get away with wrongdoing.&#x201D;Ipid is meant to conclude investigations into police misconduct and recommend to the police whether to implement a disciplinary process. It can also lay criminal charges against police officers with the National Prosecuting Authority, which takes the matter to court. Ipid head Robert McBride has meanwhile been cleared of charges of amending a report into illegal deportation of Zimbabwean murder suspects in 2010.State prosecutors withdrew the matter from the Pretoria Magistrate&#x2019;s Court after witnesses were reluctant to testify.The police minister was forced to reappoint McBride after suspending him in September. The matter went to the Constitutional Court, which ruled that Nhleko&#x2019;s suspension of McBride was invalid. Weekend Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
