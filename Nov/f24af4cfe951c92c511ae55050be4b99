Cape Town - Two Heideveld teenage girls who went missing over a week ago returned unharmed to their homes on Friday afternoon.Aqeelah Genade, 15, and Nabeelah Mitchell, 14, disappeared last Saturday. Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said yesterday that the two girls were safe, unharmed and reunited with their families.When the Weekend Argus visited the girls homes, Aqeelah was watching TV while Nabeelah was at her aunt s place.Aqeelah s mother, Amiena, said she was happy her daughter was safe. The past week was a long one for me. I looked for my daughter day and night. I only slept for the first time last night (Friday). I have no words to describe how I feel now that she is back, she said.She has not asked her daughter where she was, she wanted her to settle first.Genade said she usually read about children missing in newspapers and never thought her own daughter would disappear. It s not a good feeling not knowing where your child is for any mother, she said.Mitchell s mother, Naeema, said she felt like any mother would when her child went missing. I had sleepless nights worried about what my daughter was eating and where she was sleeping, she said.Naeema said she was glad her daughter was home unharmed, but she didn t know where she had been because she had not had time to sit down with her and talk. She came back home crying, so we haven t talked. And now she is with her aunt, she said.The Pink Ladies, a missing persons organisation, said the two girls had been found on Friday but they couldn t comment on the matter because it was still under investigation.Weekend Argus
